# Dimensionality Reduction 

Here is the note I read many blogs or posts about dimensionality reduction methods. There is a comprehensive post about all dimensionality reduction methods. [[1]][Reducing Dimensionality from Dimensionality Reduction Techniques]


## PCA


## ICA


## t-SNE

## Autoencoder
   

An ensemble is just a **collection of predictors** which come together (e.g. mean of all predictions) to give a final prediction.
