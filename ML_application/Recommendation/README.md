# Recommendation Engine 

We divides recommendation problem into 2 subproblems: 1) choosing top-N candidates and 2) ranking them.

### Collaborative filtering

We considered a recommendation problem as a **supervised** machine learning task:

* User-based collaborative filtering
* Item-based collaborative filtering
* Matrix factorization

We can also apply **unsupervised** methods to solve the recommendation problem.

At the start of a business, there is a lack of previous usersâ€™ grades, and clustering would be the best approach. We identify user groups and recommend each user in this group the same items. When we have enough data, using clustering as the first step is helpful for shrinking the selection of relevant neighbors in collaborative filtering algorithms.
