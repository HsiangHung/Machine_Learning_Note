## LangChain

### What is LangChain?

[[Mostafa Ibrahim]][What is LangChain? — A 101 overview]

LangChain is a library that helps developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It does this by providing a framework for connecting LLMs to other sources of data, such as the internet or your personal files. This allows developers to chain together multiple commands to create more complex applications.

LLMs are complex models that can be difficult to use directly. LangChain provides a simple interface that makes it easy to connect LLMs to your application.


### Examples of LangChain applications

There are many different ways that LangChain can be used to build applications. Here are a few examples [[Mostafa Ibrahim]][What is LangChain? — A 101 overview]:
* **Chatbots**: LangChain can be used to create chatbots that are powered by LLMs. These chatbots can be used to provide customer service, answer questions, or even generate creative content.
* **Question-answering systems**: LangChain can be used to create question-answering systems that are powered by LLMs. These systems can be used to answer questions about a wide range of topics
* **Summarization systems**: LangChain can be used to create summarization systems that are powered by LLMs. These systems can be used to summarize long pieces of text, such as articles or books.
* **Code generation systems**: LangChain can be used to create code generation systems that are powered by LLMs. These systems can be used to generate code for a variety of programming languages.
