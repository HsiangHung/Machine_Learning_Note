# Business Transaction 

In the AppDynamics application model [[AppDynamics]][Business Transaction@AppDynamics], a business transaction (BT) represents an **end-to-end**, **cross-tier processing path** used to fulfill a request for a service provided by the application. 

It consists of **all** required services within your environment such as login, search, and checkout that are utilized to fulfill and respond to a user-initiated request. These transactions reflect the logical way users interact with your applications. 

For example, activities such as adding an item to a shopping cart and then checking out various applications, databases, third-party APIs, and web services.


In some blogs, we may see people define as transactions. For example, in Uzziah Eyee's blog [[Uzziah Eyee]][Microservices Observability with Distributed Tracing], a **Transaction** is an **end-to-end** request-response flow, i.e from making the userâ€™s initial request to receiving the final weather response. A transaction often involves the interaction of multiple services.

Note, so a BT should be considered by an **end-to-end** request flow, and usually involves multiple services.
