Tasks we will be able to solve:

1. **Node classification**: Predict a type of a given node
2. **Link prediction**: Predict whether two nodes are linked
3. **Graph classification**
4. **Community detection**: Identify densely linked clusters of nodes
5. **Network similarity**: How similar are two (sub)networks

## 1. Node Embedding

Goal: Map nodes to $d$-dimensional embeddings such that similar nodes in the graph are embedded close together

###  Naive MLP approach fails for graphs

Modern deep learning toolbox (e.g. convolutional neural network) is designed for simple sequences & regular grids. However a network has an arbitrary size and complex topological structure (i.e., no spatial locality like grids)

![](images/graph_encoder.png)

We cannot naively feed graph into a deep neural net using adjacency matrix and features. Issues with this idea:
1. $O(|V|)$ parameters
2. Not applicable to graphs of different sizes; each graph is a "data point".
3. Sensitive to node ordering. "A->B->C" and "A->C->B" have different adjacency matrix.

## 2. Graph convolutional network

**Idea**: Nodeâ€™s neighborhood defines a computation graph

### 2.1 Multiple layer deep model

Obtain nodes aggregation information (node embeddings) from their locoal network neighbors using neural networks.

![](images/deep_model_1.png)

Model can be of **arbitrary** depth:
* Nodes have embeddings at each layer:
* Layer-0 embedding of node $v$ is its **input** feature, $x_v$.
* Layer-k embedding gets information from nodes that are $k$ hops away.

Each grey box represents a neural network. They require aggregations to be order-invariant, like sum, average, maximum.

### 2.2 Basic approach for deep model

Forward propagation rule in GNNs: 

1. Initialize input as activation units $x_v$
2. Every layer in the network:
    * Average information from neighbors
    * Apply a neural network (Note: $h^k_v$ denotes the hidden representation of node $v$ at layer $k$)

    ![](images/deep_model_3.png)

    * Trainable weight matrices (i.e., what we learn):
         * $W_k$: weight matrix for **neighborhood aggregation**.
         * $B_k$: weight matrix for transforming hidden vector of node's **itself**.


3. The output $h^k_v$ is the embedding after layer-k of neighborhood aggregation.


We can feed these embeddings into any loss function and run SGD to train the weight parameters. 

### 2.3 Train a GNN

Node embedding $z_v$ is a function of input graph:
* Supervised setting: we want to minimize the loss $L$, 
      $$\min_{\Theta}L(y, f(z_v))$$
     * $y$: node label
     * $L$ could be $L_2$ if $y$ is real number, or cross entropy if $y$ is categorical
* Unsupervised setting:
     * No node label available
     * Use the graph structure as the supervision.

#### 2.3.1 Supervised Learning

Directly train the model for a supervised task. e.g., node classification, if the node is safe or toxic drug:

![](images/train_supervised_GNN.png)

* Use cross entropy loss
$$L = \sum_{v \in V} y_v \log \left( \sigma ( z^T_v \theta ) \right) +  (1 - y_v) \log \left(  1 - \sigma (z^T_v \theta) \right),$$

where $\theta$ is classification weight, $z_v$ is node embedding from encoder output.

### 2.3.2 Unsupervised Learning

Use only the graph structure: similar nodes have similar embeddings. Unsupervised loss function can be a loss based on node proximity in the graph, or random walks.

## 3. GNN Process

![](images/train_GNN_summary_1.png)

The same aggregation parameters are shared for all nodes. The number of model parameters is sublinear in
$|V|$ and we can generalize to unseen nodes.

### 3.1 A single GNN layer

A single GNN layer mainly includes two parts:

1. Message: each node compute a message
$$m^{(k)}_u = \textrm{MSG}^{(k)} \left( \bf{h}^{(k-1)}_u \right), \ u \in \lbrace N(v) \cup v\rbrace $$
e.g. a linear layer $\bf{m}^{(k)}_v=\bf{W}^{(k)} h^{(k-1)}_v$.

2. Aggregation: aggregate messages from neighbors, e.g. sum(.), mean(.), max(.) etc aggregator

$$ \bf{h}^{(k)}_v = \textrm{AGG}^{(k)} \left( \lbrace  \bf{m}^{(k)}_u, u \in  N(v) \rbrace , \bf{m}^{(k)}_v \right),$$

### 3.2 Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

The simplest GCN has only three different operators:

* Graph convolution
* Linear layer
* Nonlinear activation

The operations are usually done in this order. Together, they make up one network layer. We can combine one or more layers to form a complete GCN.

$$ \bf{h}^{(k)}_v = \sigma \left( \bf{W}_k \sum_{u \in N(v)} \frac{h^{(k-1)}_u}{|N(v)|} + \bf{B}_k h^{(k-1)}_v  \right),$$

where the `AGG` function just simply takes weight average of neighbors.

### 3.3 GraphSAGE

GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al, NIPS 2017) is a representation learning technique for dynamic graphs. 

It can predict the embedding of a new node, without needing a re-training procedure. 

To do this, GraphSAGE uses inductive learning. It learns aggregator functions which can induce new node embedding, based on the features and neighborhood of the node.

$$ \bf{h}^{(k)}_v = \sigma \left( \left[ \bf{W}_k . \textrm{AGG} \left( \lbrace  h^{(k-1)}_u, u \in  N(v) \rbrace  \right) , \bf{B}_k h^{(k-1)}_v \right] \right).$$

Rather than summing two things together and losing track of them, we can use a general aggregation function, e.g. `Pool` or `LSTM` which keeps them separate by concatenating them [[Amal Menzli]][Graph Neural Network and Some of GNN Applications: Everything You Need to Know]. 

### 3.4 Graph attention networks

$$ \bf{h}^{(k)}_v = \sigma \left( \sum_{u \in N(v)} \alpha_{vu} \bf{W}^{(k)} h^{(k-1)}_v \right),$$

where $\alpha_{vu}$ is the attention weights (importance) of node $u$'s message to $v$. In GCN/GraphSAGE, the weight is 

$\alpha_{vu} = \frac{1}{|N(v)|}.$

However, not all nodes' neighbors are equally important.
