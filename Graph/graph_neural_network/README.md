# Graph Neural Network


## Node Embedding

Goal: Map nodes to $d$-dimensional embeddings such that similar nodes in the graph are embedded close together

Tasks we will be able to solve:
1. Node classification: Predict a type of a given node
2. Link prediction: Predict whether two nodes are linked
3. Community detection: Identify densely linked clusters of nodes
4. Network similarity: How similar are two (sub)networks

Modern deep learning toolbox is designed for simple sequences & grids. However a network has an arbitrary size and complex topological structure (i.e., no spatial locality like grids)

## Set up into Graph Neural Networwk

We cannot naively feed graph into a deep neural net using adjacency matrix and features. Issues with this idea:
1. $O(|V|)$ parameters
2. Not applicable to graphs of different sizes; each graph is a "data point".
3. Sensitive to node ordering. "A->B->C" and "A->C->B" have different adjacency matrix.

### Graph convolutional network

**Idea**: Nodeâ€™s neighborhood defines a computation graph
