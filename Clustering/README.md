# Unsupervised Clustering 

Here is the note I read many blogs or posts about dimensionality reduction methods. There is a comprehensive post about all dimensionality reduction methods. [[Elior Cohen]][Reducing Dimensionality from Dimensionality Reduction Techniques]


## Metric

### Silhouette Score

The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a **high** value indicates that the object is **well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters**. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters [[wiki]][Silhouette (clustering)].

Assume we cluster data into k clusters, for any `i` in the cluster `Ci`, we can define the mean distance between `i` and all other data points `j` in the same cluster, where `d(i,j)` is the distance between `i` and `j`
