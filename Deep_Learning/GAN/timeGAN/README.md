# TimeGAN

The seminal paper for the timeGAN model: [[Jinsung Yoon et al.]][Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks]

There are some articles describing training timeGAN models on different data:
* Stock data: [[Fabiana Clemente]][Medium, Synthetic Time-Series Data: A GAN approach]
* Energy data: [[Archit Yadav]][Medium, Modeling and Generating Time-Series Data using TimeGAN]
* Financial data: [[Sulabh Soral]][Deloitte, Timeseries Generative Adversarial Networks: Current Account Transactions]

The first two references are relevant to the GAN repo, with hyperparameter explanations and used the same experiment data source as the paper [[Jinsung Yoon et al.]][Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks]. The third one is an experiment of Deloitte's work.
