# GAN

## MinMax Loss

The value function for GAN is [[Google]][Google ML Developer - Loss Functions]

$$\min_{G} \max_{D} V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_x [ \log{\big( D(x) \big)} ] + \mathbb{E}_z[ \log{\big( 1-D(G(z)) \big)} ],$$

where $D(x)$ is the discriminator's estimate of the probability that real data instance $x$ is real, whereas $G(z)$ is the generator's output when given noise $z$, so $D(G(z))$ is the discriminator's estimate of the probability that a fake instance is real. 

$\mathbb{E}_x$ is the expected value over all real data instances, whereas $\mathbb{E}_z$ is the expected value over all random inputs to the generator, i.e. the expected value over all generated fake instances $G(z)$.

The generator tries to minimize this function while the discriminator tries to maximize it. Looking at it as a min-max game, this formulation of the loss seemed effective. 

In practice, it saturates for the generator, meaning that the generator quite frequently stops training if it doesnâ€™t catch up with the discriminator.
