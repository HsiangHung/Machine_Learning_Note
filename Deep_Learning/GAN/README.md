# GAN

## MinMax Game

The value function for GAN is

$$\min_{G} \max_{D} V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)} [ \log{\big( D(x) \big)} ] + \mathbb{E}[ \log{\big( 1-D(G(x)) \big)} ]$$

The generator tries to minimize this function while the discriminator tries to maximize it. Looking at it as a min-max game, this formulation of the loss seemed effective. 

In practice, it saturates for the generator, meaning that the generator quite frequently stops training if it doesnâ€™t catch up with the discriminator.
