# Chaining Prompts for Agentic Reasoning

Recall the common components of an AI Agent:
* **Large Language Model (LLM)**: The "brain" for understanding, reasoning, acting.
* **Tools**: External functions, APIs for interaction and enhanced capabilities.
* **Instructions**: Guidelines (system prompts) defining behavior and goals.
* **Memory**: Short-term (context) & Long-term (history) for learning and consistency.
* **Runtime/Orchestration Layer**: Manages execution flow, tool usage, observation processing.
