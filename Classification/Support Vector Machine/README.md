# Support Vector Machine


## What Does "Small Dataset" Mean?




Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These are the points that help us build our SVM [[Rohith Gandhi]][Support Vector Machine — Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms], [[Shuyu Luo]][Loss Function(Part III): Support Vector Machine]
